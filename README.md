# Here is a Python program that implements a Predictive Maintenance system for an automotive production line:

This program does the following:

1. Loads the sensor data from a CSV file using pandas.
2. Extracts the features (sensor values) and target variable (maintenance required) from the data.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
4. Trains a Random Forest regression model on the training data.
5. Makes predictions on the testing set and calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the model's performance.
6. Defines a function predict_maintenance that takes sensor values as input and predicts whether maintenance is required based on the trained model.
7. Provides an example usage of the predict_maintenance function with example sensor values.

To use this program, you need to have a CSV file named 'sensor_data.csv' containing the sensor data and the corresponding maintenance requirements. The CSV file should have columns for the sensor values and a 'Maintenance_Required' column indicating whether maintenance is required (1 for required, 0 for not required).

You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements, such as adjusting the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, using different machine learning algorithms, or processing the sensor data in a different way.

Remember to install the required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) before running the program.
